ubuntu-make (15.10ubuntu1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  [ Omer Sheikh ]
  * Change default install path to ~/.local/share/umake/, depending on
    $XDG_DATA_HOME.
  * Add tests for those.
  * Improve tests stability in different environment (particularly jenkins) by
    creating wrapper around pexpect.spawnu. The wrapper sets the virtual
    terminal dimensions before calling pexpect.spawnu. This is to solve the
    problem of newline and carriage returns appearing in the stdout of created
    processes when testing under jenkins.

  [ Sebastian Schuberth ]
  * Fix changelog name.
  * Set the ANDROID_HOME and NDK_ROOT environment variables for android NDK
    frameworks.

  [ Jared Ravetch ]
  * Fix user message when prompting user to restart shell session.

  [ Didier Roche ]
  * Add a --version option to print current ubuntu make version. The rules are:
    - if the user is on a released version, then print this version
    - if the user is on a git branch, use:
      - version-#commits-shortsha1 if there is no local or staged changes
      - version-#commits-shortsha1-dirty if there is some locals or staged
        changes
    - finally, if the user is a local checkout, but without git history, just
      print: version+unknown
  * Fix --remove when used before a category name. Now, you can properly
    umake --remove <category> <framework> and the framework will be removed.
  * Fix framework env variables not removed for zsh shells on --remove.
  * Fix cmd list mangling for large Android NDK tests.
  * Add some autoreleasing script, to bump version, add them to stage, tag and
    commit.
  * Enable multiple decompressions to end up in same directory and adapt
    frameworks to this new framework API.
  * Adjust DownloadCenter number of threads to match number of assets to
    download.
  * Make BaseInstaller supporting multiple assets downloads and fix it to only
    reflect download progress when we have all download size data. We could
    have one download finishing up (and so global being at 100%) while other
    downloads didn't start yet. Ensure we have all assets size before reporting
    first download global progress.
  * Fix as well cleaned path to not be removed.
  * Filter in BaseInstaller to not decompress assets that are files to copy.
  * Add a bunch of small, medium and large tests for versioning, removal, env
    variable cleanups, parallel decompressions in the same directory, done
    callback counts for decompression and downloads.
  * Add a way to specify multiple ports (and hosts) in medium tests. This will
    be used in future frameworks which rely both on https and http downloads.
    Test tools can now expose multiple ports inside the container.
    Changed as well all medium tests to adapt to this new API.
  * Ensure we source .profile when executing command in container.
  * Various changes to run medium tests even on system installed version.
  * Save new jenkins jobs enabling medium tests and add branch-targeted jenkins
    job to test branches not merged yet into master.
  * Better medium tests stability support and optimization.
  * Package new version of pexpect and add dependency markers.
  * Some PR post-merge fixes and various refactoring.
  * Remove WIP marker in README.

  * Add support for installing android SDK only by Sebastian Schuberth

      an exit code of 1.
    - add and modify large tests, to ensure that each framework (those using
      BaseInstaller and those having some dedicated code path) are behaving
      the same for errors.

      here as well.

  * Addition for the test jenkins server:
    - Add helper to display binary depends
    - Output xml tests and coverage report
    - Add xunit artefacts support in runtests
  * Some tests enhancement for working in the daily jenkins environment:
    - Change installing in conflict package prediction.
    - Give some time for the container in medium tests to start
    - Remove full install timeout logic. Instead, have a timeout if there
      is no new stdout/progress report change for a while. This ensure
      less flakyness in case of really slow network.
    - Remove on output testing first INFO message detection as it's a false
      positive.
  * No output by default when running tests:
    - Coverage tests doesn't print any stdout or logging info unless a tests
      is failing.
    - Debug profile is using the debug logging configuraiton as well.
    - Don't rely on importing tests/__init__.py to define logging format for
      nose.
    - Ensure subprocess (medium/large tests) set the same logging level as well.
    - Add a stdout hanlder in subprocess as well while testing (using
      the correct profile and be able to detect warning/errors)
  * debian/rules:
    - no need for --no-config for running tests anymore
  * Misc cleanups:
    - some refactoring of runtests
    - remove unusued imports
    - removed unused profile options
    - update documentation for the new logging profiles change.
  * Have pep8 tests passing on system version as well.
  * Add Spanish, Basque and Chinese (Hong Kong) translations. Thanks to all
    translators!
