  * Fix Go support as of 1.5.3, they now publishes a sha256 instead of a sha1
    checksum.
  * Adapt tests to it.
  * A lot of work on tests:
    - add local/vm/remote args to runtests to easily run tests in locally,
      in an adt environment or remotely on the official infrastructure.
    - minimizing autopkgtests installation
    - docker fixes with proxy for medium tests
    - ensure we run with a dummy xorg driver

ubuntu-make (16.01) xenial; urgency=medium

  [ Galileo Sartor ]
  * Always deliver the latest Unity3D version (beta) to our users.
  * Ensure we always download latest available eclipse java IDE version. This
    enables users to now get eclipse Mars from Ubuntu Make!

  [ Didier Roche ]
  * Enable setting up Firefox Dev as default browser.
  * Move Visual Studio Code to IDE category. Keep it still on the web category
    for backward compatiblity. Adapts tests to ensure both category works
    (with a warning on the web one).
  * Move the testing infrastructure from jenkins to ubuntu autopkgtests:
    - create pep8/small/medium/large/all targets to mimic runautopkgtests
      behavior.
    - add a setup test bed, installing an ubuntu-desktop image, grabbing
      git branch or system package and generating stats info.
    - add another collecting coverage test to generate and copy stats
      to artefacts directory.
    - a custom target is triggered when one or more specific tests are desired
      like --env="TESTS=tests/small/<foo>.py
      tests.small.foo:TestClass:test_bar".
    - all those tests are handled by a TESTS env variable. If not set, we run
      pep8 and small tests.
    - creating utils and scripts to factorize most of the logic.
  * Protect against invalid tar archive that can be opened but not fully
    extracted.
  * Remove libxp6 dep from Stencyl as optional and not available from wily.
  * Install test dependencies from package and autopkgtests list.
    Use that logic in both autopkgtest infra and jenkins.
  * Make test_install_progress more robust as apt 1.1.5 changed its update
    signaling behavior.
  * Add in baseinstaller some way to only match last link when parsing.
  * Rework foreign architecture addition and detection to ensure we only
    call it once (we were calling them once per package previously), fix some
    races in cache handling. Move this facility to tools and restructure tests
     for this, while adding some more.
  * Add locks to avoid a race condition when creating temp file (to not create
    them as root) and add a new contextwrapper for as_root() with its tests.
  * Drop sshpass in favor of ssh key for docker image connection.
  * Some misc fixes:
    - Change some error messages and making them localizable.
    - fix an issue to avoid nested fakeroot calls.
    - Ensure we always kill children process and not the wrapper in container.
    - Add a fallback when os.getlogin() returns transient errors.
    - Normalize end of line tests comparaison.
    - Fix some possible failure when issuing a progressbar update.
    - Restructure, decouple and grab additional mocks for tests
    - Restore properly the initial environment in test_settings to avoid env
      leaks bugs.
    - Import cleanups.

  * Standardize language test bed to run in plain english whatever your
    configuration is.
  * Misc. tests enhancements and tools fixes.
  * Move build dependencies only needed for tests to another ppa
    (ppa:ubuntu-desktop/ubuntu-make-builddeps) and add it in jenkins tests.
    This way, people using Ubuntu Make on older release are not impacted by
    the need of newer version of tests frameworks like pexpect and won't
    install them. Hook that ppa in Travis CI, our jenkins infra and refresh
    contributor intro to ask adding that ppa for testing.
  * Enhance our jenkins job for testing a pull request branch and other minor
    test job enhancements.
  * Update French translations.
  * Update translation template for new and updated frameworks.

  [ Omer Sheikh ]
  * Change default install path to ~/.local/share/umake/, depending on
    $XDG_DATA_HOME.
  * Add tests for those.
  * Improve tests stability in different environment (particularly jenkins) by
    creating wrapper around pexpect.spawnu. The wrapper sets the virtual
    terminal dimensions before calling pexpect.spawnu. This is to solve the
    problem of newline and carriage returns appearing in the stdout of created
    processes when testing under jenkins.

  [ Sebastian Schuberth ]
  * Fix changelog name.
  * Set the ANDROID_HOME and NDK_ROOT environment variables for android NDK
    frameworks.

  [ Jared Ravetch ]

    - if the user is on a released version, then print this version
    - if the user is on a git branch, use:
      - version-#commits-shortsha1 if there is no local or staged changes
      - version-#commits-shortsha1-dirty if there is some locals or staged
        changes
    - finally, if the user is a local checkout, but without git history, just
      print: version+unknown
  * Fix --remove when used before a category name. Now, you can properly
    umake --remove <category> <framework> and the framework will be removed.
  * Fix framework env variables not removed for zsh shells on --remove.
  * Fix cmd list mangling for large Android NDK tests.
  * Add some autoreleasing script, to bump version, add them to stage, tag and
    commit.
  * Enable multiple decompressions to end up in same directory and adapt
    frameworks to this new framework API.
  * Adjust DownloadCenter number of threads to match number of assets to
    download.
  * Make BaseInstaller supporting multiple assets downloads and fix it to only
    reflect download progress when we have all download size data. We could
    have one download finishing up (and so global being at 100%) while other
    downloads didn't start yet. Ensure we have all assets size before reporting
    first download global progress.
  * Fix as well cleaned path to not be removed.
  * Filter in BaseInstaller to not decompress assets that are files to copy.
  * Add a bunch of small, medium and large tests for versioning, removal, env
    variable cleanups, parallel decompressions in the same directory, done
    callback counts for decompression and downloads.
  * Add a way to specify multiple ports (and hosts) in medium tests. This will
    be used in future frameworks which rely both on https and http downloads.
    Test tools can now expose multiple ports inside the container.
    Changed as well all medium tests to adapt to this new API.
  * Ensure we source .profile when executing command in container.
  * Various changes to run medium tests even on system installed version.
  * Save new jenkins jobs enabling medium tests and add branch-targeted jenkins
    job to test branches not merged yet into master.
  * Better medium tests stability support and optimization.
  * Package new version of pexpect and add dependency markers.
  * Some PR post-merge fixes and various refactoring.
  * Remove WIP marker in README.

  * Addition for the test jenkins server:
    - Add helper to display binary depends
    - Output xml tests and coverage report
    - Add xunit artefacts support in runtests
  * Some tests enhancement for working in the daily jenkins environment:
    - Change installing in conflict package prediction.
    - Give some time for the container in medium tests to start
    - Remove full install timeout logic. Instead, have a timeout if there
      is no new stdout/progress report change for a while. This ensure
      less flakyness in case of really slow network.
    - Remove on output testing first INFO message detection as it's a false
      positive.
  * No output by default when running tests:
    - Coverage tests doesn't print any stdout or logging info unless a tests
      is failing.
    - Debug profile is using the debug logging configuraiton as well.
    - Don't rely on importing tests/__init__.py to define logging format for
      nose.
    - Ensure subprocess (medium/large tests) set the same logging level as well.
    - Add a stdout hanlder in subprocess as well while testing (using
      the correct profile and be able to detect warning/errors)
  * debian/rules:
    - no need for --no-config for running tests anymore
  * Misc cleanups:
    - some refactoring of runtests
    - remove unusued imports
    - removed unused profile options
    - update documentation for the new logging profiles change.
  * Have pep8 tests passing on system version as well.
  * Add Spanish, Basque and Chinese (Hong Kong) translations. Thanks to all
    translators!

ubuntu-developer-tools-center (0.0.4) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Enhance some tests by adding more info in case of failure and decouple
    some concerns.
  * Fix medium tests in using server name back as sbuild supports it again.
  * Refreshed certificates which expired and document how to get longer
    ones.
  * First trial to get medium tests running as autopkgtests, but disabled
    for now (Docker permission error inside the autopkg chroot)
  * Refactor i18n support with dropping babel and automatically run the
    commands when setuptools is building.
  * Add fr and zh_CN translations.

ubuntu-developer-tools-center (0.0.3) utopic; urgency=medium

  * Fix coverage reports by importing tested modules only when needed and
    when overriding "packages" and "__files__", by reloading the module
  * Some cleanups (removed unused imports)
  * Add allow-stderr for adt tests: as nose-cov print some debug output
    at start which makes adt failing then. As we control,
    stderr and warnings during tests, disable this check.
